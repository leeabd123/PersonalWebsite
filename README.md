## Application Features

### Core Features

- [X] Websites have 3 defined sections: main header, biography, and videos.
- [X] Embedded video of recorded video interview task.
- [X] CSS styling of background colors, images, text, and positioning. 
- [X] At least one accessible feature (i.e color sensitive choices, alt-text for images, etc)

### Accessible Features

In the section below, list out all of the accessible features implemented in your project:

1. Feature: I incorporated “more info” boxes to explain certain what certain sections contain to the user

2. Feature: I used a gray scale transition feature in CSS. This feature is in sections whose color some users may find bright. This feature is located in the About Me, Bio, Projects, Skills, and Contact Me sections. The user can hover over these sections and the color will dim and improve their readability.

3. Feature: I tried to incorporate larger font sizes to help improve readability on the website. Additionally, I also used flexbox so the elements of the website shrink horizontally when the user makes the window on their PC smaller. 

## Reflection

* If you had more time, what would you like to incorporate into your website? How would it improve the user’s experience? What challenges would you anticipate when trying to implement the feature?
---
 
I wanted to incorporate a feature that would allow me to change the color scheme of the whole website with one button. I wanted a color-blind accessibility feature. This would improve the accessibility of the website and allow the website to accommodate to more users. Some challenges I would have trying to implement this feature would be figuring out how to get a button to call back to the server and change the color of many sections at once. Also, all the sections would not be changing to the same exact color so I would have to figure out how to change all sections to their corresponding colors. Another challenge I would encounter was how I could then reverse all the sections back to their original color with one click of a button.

* Why do you think web accessibility is important, and why did you choose your specific features to include?

----
Accessibility is important because in order to achieve a wide reach and distribute the benefits of your product, you must cater to as many users as you can. Users have a variety of experiences and each user experience or ability to interact with a website is uniquely affected by accessibility. I want to strive to create an interface that is conscious, and developed with care and foresight of the various types of users. Allowing everyone to achieve the same level of engaging quality user experience. This sends a positive message to a user, making them feel like they were thought of in the design process, and that their access matters. 

I chose these specific features because these are features on a website I rarely see. Sometimes the colors of a website are really bright and hard to read even for someone without eye sensitivity. While making these features I thought of my aunt who has eye sensitivity and how I would want her to be able to look at my personal website with ease. 

I chose alternate text in order to explain certain sections of my website because the alternate text is read aloud by screen readers. 

I chose large font sizes so people who are visually impaired have an easier time recognizing text on my page.
